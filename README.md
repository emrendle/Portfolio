# Personal Portfolio
## Description
This portfolio is a living, growing application that will expand as I complete projects. It is meant to serve as a showcase for the projects I have completed. My personal goal was to create something clean, easy to read, and functional without sacrificing stylistic elements. 

## Features
* This page is media-responsive with an alternative layout for mobile users. 

* Navigation bar is fixed and contains links to the sections of the page, as well as a link to download my resume and contact me via email.

* About me section includes all necessary contact information (phone, email, address, and resume) as well as links to my GitHub and LinkedIn pages. 

* Skills section includes progress bars so that my proficiency with each skill can be displayed in an easily digestible manner. 

* There are cards for the projects I wish to showcase, along with a featured project that showcases my most recent completed project. Each card has a link to the deployed application as well as a link to the GitHub repository so that the source code can be viewed.

## Commentary
* This page was adapted from a Bulma CSS template [https://bulmatemplates.github.io/bulma-templates/templates/personal.html]. 

* Still working on a headshot of myself for the About Me section!
