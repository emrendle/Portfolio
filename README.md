# Homework 2 - Personal Portfolio
## Description
The goal of this project was to create a personal portfolio utilizing the CSS and HTML skills learned in weeks 1 & 2. This portfolio is a living, growing document that will expand as I complete projects - it will serve as a location to showcase the work I have done. My personal goal was to create something minimalistic, easy to read, and functional without sacrificing stylistic elements.

## Features
* This page is media-responsive with an alternative layout for mobile users. 

* In lieu of deployed projects, there are placeholder links and images with hover-over text titles. 

* Header is fixed and contains the navigation bar.

* Navigation bar includes links to contact me via email as well as links to my Linkedin and Github profiles (all links should be functional and open in a new tab). These links have titles when hovered over in case the icons are not descriptive. 

## Future Directions
* Mobile style could be more polished - the title overlays aren't mobile-friendly and a different approach for mobile could be helpful.

* Project image section would likely need to be restructured when more projects are added, especially if one project would benefit from being highlighted more than the others.
